# DLND_Projects
Projects completed as part of Deep Learning Nanodegree using CNN, RNN &amp; GAN.

## [Project 1: Dog Breed Classifier](https://github.com/Samradh007/DLND_Projects/tree/master/Dog_breed_classifier_CNN) 

This project aims to build a convolutional neural network to determine the breed of dog or the closest breed to a human's face, based on the input image.

## [Project 2: Script Generator](https://github.com/Samradh007/DLND_Projects/tree/master/Generate_TV_Scripts_RNN) 

The project to train a model on TV Script and learn to generate its own using RNN. The model is trained on Seinfeld scripts provided and the results are included.

## [Project 3: Face Generator](https://github.com/Samradh007/DLND_Projects/tree/master/Face_Generation_GAN) 

The project explores the GAN framework and uses it to train a model on Celeb_faces dataset to learn and generate new human faces on its own.

## [Project 4: SageMaker Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/Samradh007/DLND_Projects/tree/master/AWS_Sentiment_Analysis_RNN) 

The project required to build a recurrent neural network to determine the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB dataset. The model is developed using Amazon Sagemaker service and is deployed to use in a simple web application.
